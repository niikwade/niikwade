## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Michael Nii Nai Nai-Kwade. I am a recent (MSc) graduate of the University of Aberdeen, where I studied Information Technology.

I am building knowledge and skills in cyber/information security, and ML/Al.
I have completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate course on Coursera, as well as the Ceritified in Cybersecurity (CC) from ISC2.I am looking forward to take the SSCP, Security+ and eventually the CISSP.

I am looking to collaborate on SOC, digital forensic and incident response projects, as well as on ML/Al relating to cybersecurity. I have interest in DevOps, as such, will be looking to collaborate and learn from others.

I can be reached on X (@niikwade). 

I am really excited to have started this tech journer and can't wait to see the wonderful things that come out of it.
