## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is Michael Nii Nai-Kwade. I am a recent MSc graduate of the University of Aberdeen, where I studied Information Technology.

I am building knowledge and skills in information security, ML/Al, and Data science.
I am currently taking the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate course on Coursera. I already have a CC (ceritified in cybersecurity) from ISC2, and looking to take the SSCP, Security+, Network+ and eventually the CISSP.

I am looking to collaborate on SOC, digital forensic analysis projects, as well as on ML/Al relating to cybersecurity.

I can be reached via X (@niikwade). 

I am really excited to have started this tech journer and can't wait to see the wonderful things that come out of it.
